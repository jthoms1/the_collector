  ## Output Format
  Return your analysis as a JSON array. Each item should include:

  - "image_path": the path to the analyzed image
  - All relevant fields for that item type
  - Use empty string "" for fields you cannot determine

  Example output:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "comic",
      "image_path": "Comics/IMG_001.jpeg",
      "title": "Amazing Spider-Man",
      "issue_number": "300",
      "volume": "1",

      "cover_date": "May 1988",
      "variant": "",
      "key_issue": "First appearance of Venom",
      "condition": "Very Fine",
      "notes": ""
    },
    {
      "type": "card",
      "image_path": "Cards/IMG_002.jpeg",
