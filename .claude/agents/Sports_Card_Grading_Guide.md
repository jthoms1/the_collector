## Four Core Grading Criteria

All professional grading services evaluate cards using the same four fundamental categories:

### 1. Centering

Centering measures how well the card image is positioned between its borders. It's expressed as a ratio (e.g., 60/40 means 60% of the border is on one side, 40% on the other).

| Grade Level | Front Centering | Back Centering |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 10 (Pristine/Gem) | 50/50 - 55/45 | 60/40 or better |
| 9 (Mint) | 55/45 - 60/40 | 70/30 or better |
| 8 (NM-MT) | 60/40 - 65/35 | 80/20 or better |
| 7 (NM) | 65/35 - 70/30 | 90/10 or better |
| 6 (EX-MT) | 70/30 - 75/25 | 95/5 or better |
| 5 (EX) | 75/25 - 80/20 | -- |
| 4 (VG-EX) | 80/20 - 85/15 | -- |
| 3 (VG) | 85/15 - 90/10 | -- |
| 2 (Good) | 90/10 or worse | -- |

**How to measure centering:**
1. Measure the left and right borders (or top and bottom)
2. Calculate the ratio: smaller border / larger border
3. Example: 2mm left border, 3mm right border = 40/60 centering

### 2. Corners

Corners are one of the most scrutinized areas. Professional graders examine corners under magnification.

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Perfect** | Razor sharp, no wear visible even under magnification |
| **Sharp** | Appears perfect to naked eye, microscopic wear under magnification |
| **Slightly Fuzzy** | Very minor softness, barely perceptible |
| **Fuzzy** | Noticeable softness or light fraying |
| **Lightly Rounded** | Clear rounding beginning to show |
| **Rounded** | Obvious rounding, significant wear |
| **Heavily Rounded** | Extreme wear, corners severely blunted |

**Corner defects to look for:**
- Fraying (fibers separating)
- Dings (small dents or nicks)
- Bends (corner turned up or down)
- Paper loss (white showing through)

### 3. Edges

Edges run along the four sides of the card between the corners.

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Perfect** | Crisp, clean, no visible wear |
| **Near Perfect** | Microscopic imperfections under magnification only |
| **Minor Wear** | Slight roughness visible upon close inspection |
| **Chipping** | Small white spots where color has flaked off |
| **Notching** | Small nicks or cuts along the edge |
| **Layering** | Card layers beginning to separate |
| **Feathering** | Fuzzy, frayed edge appearance |

**Note:** Colored edges (like 1971 Topps black borders) are notorious for showing wear more prominently.

### 4. Surface

Surface evaluation examines both the front and back of the card for any flaws.

| Defect Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Print Lines** | Factory lines from printing rollers |
| **Scratches** | Linear marks on the surface |
| **Scuffing** | Areas where gloss has been rubbed away |
| **Creases** | Folded lines (major grade killer) |
| **Staining** | Discoloration from wax, gum, water, etc. |
| **Dimples/Dents** | Small indentations in the surface |
| **Fish Eyes** | Small circular print defects |
| **Snow** | White specks from printing process |
| **Focus Issues** | Blurry or misregistered printing |

---

## Grade Limiters

**A single major flaw can cap your grade regardless of how perfect everything else is.**

### Crease Severity and Grade Impact

Creases are the most significant grade limiters. Even a card with perfect centering and sharp corners will be capped by crease damage.

| Crease Type | Description | Maximum Grade |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Hairline/Light** | Barely visible, doesn't break surface | VG-EX 4 |
| **Minor** | Visible but doesn't crack surface | VG 3 |
| **Moderate** | Clearly visible, may show surface crack | Good 2 |
| **Heavy** | Deep crease, surface broken | Fair 1.5 |
| **Multiple/Severe** | Multiple creases or paper separation | Poor 1 |

**Crease Detection Tips:**
- Hold card at eye level and tilt toward light source
- Run finger lightly across surface to feel indentations
- Check both front and back - back creases count too
- Corner creases (diagonal from corner) are common

### Other Absolute Grade Limiters

| Defect | Maximum Grade | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Writing/Ink marks** | VG 3 (often lower) | Pen worse than pencil |
| **Tape residue/damage** | Good 2 | Even if tape removed |
| **Trimming** | No grade (Authentic only) | Altered card |
| **Color added/touched up** | No grade | Altered card |
| **Hole punch** | Poor 1 | Common in vintage |
| **Water damage/warping** | VG 3 or lower | Depends on severity |
| **Staining (heavy)** | VG-EX 4 or lower | Light stains less impact |
| **Paper loss** | Good 2 or lower | Missing cardboard |

### The "Weakest Link" Principle

Your final grade will typically be determined by your worst category:

```
Example Card Assessment:
- Centering: 55/45 (9-10 territory)
- Corners: Sharp (9 territory)
- Edges: Clean (9 territory)
- Surface: Light crease (4 territory)

Final Grade: PSA 4 (limited by the crease)
```

## Photography Guide for Card Assessment

Proper photography is essential for accurate grading assessment from images.

### Required Photos

1. **Front - straight on** (primary assessment)
2. **Back - straight on** (centering, stains, marks)
3. **Front - angled with light** (reveals surface scratches, creases)
4. **Close-up of corners** (if concerned about corner condition)

### Lighting Setup

| Method | Best For | How To |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Angled lighting** | Surface defects, scratches, creases | Position light at 45-degree angle to card |
| **Direct overhead** | Overall condition, centering | Light directly above, card flat |
| **Natural daylight** | True color assessment | Near window, avoid direct sunlight |
| **Multiple angles** | Hidden defects | Rotate card while photographing |

### Photography Tips

- **Use a dark background** - Black or dark gray reveals edges clearly
- **Avoid glare** - Especially on glossy/chrome cards; angle to eliminate reflections
- **Stabilize camera** - Use tripod or rest phone on surface
- **Focus on card** - Tap screen to focus; ensure corners are sharp in image
- **High resolution** - Allows zooming to inspect details
- **Include scale reference** - Penny or ruler helps show actual size

### What Photos Reveal vs. Hide

| Visible in Photos | May Be Hidden |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Centering | Subtle surface scratches |
| Major corner wear | Microscopic corner wear |
| Obvious creases | Hairline creases |
| Color/print issues | Texture issues |
| Edge chipping (with good lighting) | Minor surface dimples |
| Staining | Faint pencil marks |

## Autographed Card Grading

### Dual Grade System

Most grading companies provide TWO grades for autographed cards:
1. **Card Grade** - Condition of the card itself (standard 1-10)
2. **Autograph Grade** - Quality of the signature (typically 1-10)

### Autograph Grading Criteria

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **10** | Bold, perfect placement, no flaws |
| **9** | Strong signature, minor imperfection (slightly light, minor placement issue) |
| **8** | Good signature, visible flaws (light spots, bubbling, minor smear) |
| **7** | Legible but noticeable issues (fading, bleeding, off-center) |
| **6** | Heavily flawed (significant fading, smearing, poor placement) |
| **5** | Barely acceptable (very faded, major issues, partially obscured) |

### Factors Affecting Autograph Grade

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Boldness** | Faded or light signatures grade lower |
| **Placement** | Centered on card/sweet spot grades higher |
| **Completeness** | Full signature vs. initials |
| **Smearing/Bleeding** | Ink that ran or smeared |
| **Pen type** | Sharpie/marker preferred over ballpoint |
| **Surface interaction** | How well ink adhered to card surface |

### Special Considerations

- **Vintage autographs** may have naturally faded over 50+ years
- **Card condition** is often lower on signed vintage (handled for signing)
- **Authentication** is crucial - PSA/DNA, JSA, or Beckett Authentication
- **On-card vs. sticker autos** - On-card generally more desirable

## Known Issues by Era and Set

Certain sets have notorious manufacturing problems. Knowing these helps set realistic grade expectations.

### 1970s Sets

| Set | Common Issues | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-------|
| **1971 Topps (Black Border)** | Edge chipping, corner wear shows white | Most difficult vintage set to find high grade |
| **1972 Topps** | Poor centering, print quality varies | |
| **1975 Topps Mini** | Centering issues, small size makes flaws prominent | |

### 1980s Sets

| Set | Common Issues | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-------|
| **1989 Upper Deck** | Notorious centering problems | Even pack-fresh cards often 60/40 or worse |
| **1986 Fleer Basketball** | Centering, print snow on borders | Michael Jordan rookie year |
| **1984 Topps** | Diamond cut corners | Don Mattingly rookie year |
| **1987 Topps** | Wood grain border shows wear | |
| **1989 Topps Big Baseball** | Oversized = more handling damage | |

### 1990s Sets

| Set | Common Issues | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-------|
| **1990 Leaf** | Print lines common | |
| **1992 Topps Stadium Club** | Surface scratches from foil packs | |
| **1993 Finest** | Protective coating issues | |
| **1990s SkyBox/Hoops** | Surface scuffs | |

### Modern Chrome/Refractor Issues (2000s-Present)

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Refractor lines** | Visible lines in the refractor pattern |
| **Print dots** | Small printing imperfections |
| **Edge chipping** | Chrome surface chips easier than paper |
| **Pack damage** | Scratches from pack insertion |

---

## Chrome and Refractor Card Grading

Modern chrome cards (Topps Chrome, Bowman Chrome, Prizm, Select, etc.) require special attention.

### Chrome-Specific Defects

| Defect | Description | Grade Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Surface scratches** | Very common, check under angled light | Minor = 8-9, Heavy = 6-7 |
| **Print dots/specks** | Factory printing imperfections | Minor = 9, Noticeable = 7-8 |
| **Refractor lines** | Lines visible in the refractor pattern | Depends on severity |
| **Chromium flaking** | Chrome layer peeling or chipping | Significant deduction |
| **Finger prints** | Oil marks on surface | Can sometimes be cleaned |
| **Pack fresh scratches** | Scratches from insertion/removal from pack | Very common |

### Refractor Types and Grading

| Type | Characteristics | Grading Notes |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Base Chrome** | Standard chromium finish | Standard criteria apply |
| **Refractor** | Rainbow light refraction | Check for refractor lines |
| **Prizm/Silver** | Parallel lines pattern | Lines can hide defects |
| **Gold/Color parallels** | Colored borders | Border wear shows clearly |
| **Superfractor (1/1)** | Heavy gold chromium | Scratches very visible |

### Inspecting Chrome Cards

1. **Use angled halogen or LED light** - Reveals scratches invisible under direct light
2. **Check edges carefully** - Chrome chips easier than standard cardstock
3. **Inspect corners** - Chrome corners ding easily
4. **Look for print dots** - Common factory defect on chrome
5. **Verify no fingerprints** - Handle with gloves or by edges only

## Should I Grade This Card?

Not every card is worth the cost of professional grading. Use this decision framework.

### Grading Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Factor | Consider Grading If... |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Raw value** | Card is worth $50+ ungraded |
| **Condition** | You believe it will grade 8+ (modern) or 5+ (vintage key) |
| **Player significance** | Hall of Famer, rookie card, key card |
| **Population** | Low PSA population in high grades |
| **Personal collection** | You want long-term protection/display |

### When Grading Makes Sense

**Grade these cards:**
- Key rookie cards in high grade potential
- Modern rookies of star players in mint condition
- Vintage Hall of Famers in any presentable condition
- Low population parallels/refractors
- Cards you plan to sell

**Skip grading for:**
- Common 1990s cards (overproduced era)
- Cards with obvious flaws that will grade 5 or below (modern)
- Low-value base cards
- Cards worth less than 3x the grading fee

### Grading Fee Thresholds

| Card Value (Raw) | Recommendation |
|------------------|----------------|
| Under $20 | Generally not worth grading |
| $20-50 | Grade only if likely PSA 9-10 |
| $50-100 | Grade if likely PSA 8+ |
| $100-500 | Grade if likely PSA 7+ |
| $500+ | Almost always worth grading |
| Vintage keys | Grade regardless of condition |
