## Four Core Grading Criteria

All professional grading services evaluate TCG cards using the same four fundamental categories:

### 1. Centering

Centering measures how well the card image is positioned between its borders.

| Grade Level | Front Centering | Back Centering |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 10 (Gem Mint) | 55/45 or better | 75/25 or better |
| 9 (Mint) | 60/40 or better | 90/10 or better |
| 8 (NM-MT) | 65/35 or better | No limit |
| 7 (NM) | 70/30 or better | No limit |
| 6 (EX-MT) | 75/25 or better | No limit |
| 5 (EX) | 80/20 or better | No limit |

**TCG-Specific Centering Notes:**
- Alpha/Beta MTG cards often have poor centering by modern standards
- Japanese cards may have different border proportions
- Full-art and borderless cards still have centering based on art placement
- Black-bordered cards show centering issues more prominently

### 2. Corners

Corners are heavily scrutinized on TCG cards, especially black-bordered ones.

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Perfect** | Razor sharp, no wear visible even under magnification |
| **Sharp** | Appears perfect to naked eye, microscopic wear under magnification |
| **Slightly Soft** | Very minor softness, barely perceptible |
| **Soft/Fuzzy** | Noticeable softness or light fraying |
| **Lightly Rounded** | Clear rounding beginning to show |
| **Rounded** | Obvious rounding, significant wear |
| **Heavily Rounded** | Extreme wear, corners severely blunted |

**Corner defects to look for:**
- Fraying (fibers separating)
- Dings (small dents or nicks)
- Bends (corner turned up or down)
- Paper loss (white showing through)
- Peeling (layers separating)

### 3. Edges

Edges are particularly important for black-bordered cards where wear shows as white.

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Perfect** | Crisp, clean, no visible wear |
| **Near Perfect** | Microscopic imperfections under magnification only |
| **Minor Whitening** | Small white spots on black borders |
| **Moderate Whitening** | Visible whitening along edges |
| **Chipping** | Small pieces of card surface missing |
| **Notching** | Small nicks or cuts along the edge |
| **Layering** | Card layers beginning to separate |

**Black Border Edge Wear:**
- Any whitening on black borders significantly impacts grade
- MTG Alpha/Beta/Unlimited all have black borders
- Yu-Gi-Oh! has various border colors by era
- Edge wear is often the grade limiter for played cards

### 4. Surface

Surface evaluation examines both the front and back of the card for any flaws.

| Defect Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Scratches** | Linear marks on the surface |
| **Scuffing** | Areas where gloss has been rubbed away |
| **Print Lines** | Factory lines from printing process |
| **Ink Spots** | Excess ink from printing |
| **Creases** | Folded lines (major grade killer) |
| **Staining** | Discoloration from various sources |
| **Clouding** | Hazy appearance on foil cards |
| **Curling** | Card bending (common with foils) |

## Game-Specific Considerations

### Magic: The Gathering

**Edition Hierarchy (by collectibility):**
1. Alpha (Limited Edition Alpha) - 1993, rounded corners
2. Beta (Limited Edition Beta) - 1993, squared corners
3. Unlimited - 1993, white borders
4. Revised and later

**MTG-Specific Factors:**
- **Alpha Corner Radius**: Alpha cards have distinctly rounded corners
- **Color Saturation**: Alpha/Beta have richer colors than later prints
- **Reserved List**: Cards that will never be reprinted (e.g., Power Nine)
- **Border Color**: Black vs white borders affects desirability
- **Foil Types**: Traditional foil, etched foil, retro frame, showcase

**Power Nine:**
The nine most powerful and collectible cards:
- Black Lotus
- Ancestral Recall
- Time Walk
- Mox Pearl, Sapphire, Jet, Ruby, Emerald
- Timetwister

**Common MTG Defects:**
- Edge whitening on black borders
- Print lines (especially common on older cards)
- Surface scratches from shuffling
- Curling (especially foils)

### Yu-Gi-Oh!

**Edition Hierarchy:**
1. 1st Edition - "1st Edition" text below card art
2. Unlimited - No edition marking
3. Limited Edition - Special promotional printings

**Yu-Gi-Oh!-Specific Factors:**
- **Set Codes**: Important for identification (e.g., LOB-001)
- **Rarity**: Ultra Rare, Secret Rare, Ghost Rare, etc.
- **Foil Patterns**: Multiple foil types by era and rarity
- **Language**: Japanese vs English market
- **Error Cards**: Misprints can be very valuable

**Key Sets:**

- **Rarity**: Fabled (extremely rare), Legendary, Majestic, etc.

### One Piece Card Game

**One Piece Factors:**
- **Parallel Art**: Different art versions
- **Leader/Character Cards**: Different card types
- **Japanese vs English**: Market differences
- **Serial Numbers**: Some cards are numbered

### Pokemon TCG

**Pokemon-Specific Factors:**
- **Edition**: 1st Edition, Shadowless, Unlimited (massive value differences for WOTC era)
- **Era**: WOTC (1999-2003), e-Series, Modern (2020+)
- **Silvering**: Silver foil showing at edges (very common on holos)
- **Holo Pattern**: Cosmos, Galaxy, Reverse Holo, Full Art textures

**Edition Identification (WOTC Era):**

| Edition | Identification | Value |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **1st Edition** | Gold "Edition 1" stamp on left side | Most valuable |
| **Shadowless** | No shadow behind artwork box, no stamp | Second most valuable |
| **Unlimited** | Shadow behind artwork box, no stamp | Most common |

**Silvering Grade Impact:**

| Silvering Level | Description | Max Grade |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **None/Trace** | Not visible or barely under magnification | PSA 10 |
| **Light** | Visible but minimal | PSA 9 |
| **Moderate** | Clearly visible on 1-2 edges | PSA 8 |
| **Heavy** | Multiple edges affected | PSA 7 |
| **Severe** | All edges heavily affected | PSA 6 or below |

**Era-Specific Notes:**
- **WOTC (1999-2003)**: Inconsistent quality control, silvering endemic, centering often poor
- **Modern (2020+)**: Better print quality, texture patterns can show wear, pack damage common
- **Japanese**: Slightly smaller cards, generally better print quality and centering

## Foil Card Assessment

Foil cards require special attention:

### Common Foil Issues

| Issue | Description | Grade Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Scratches** | Visible scratches on foil surface | Significant |
| **Clouding** | Hazy or foggy foil pattern | Moderate to Significant |
| **Curling** | Card bends due to foil layer | Minor to Moderate |
| **Peeling** | Foil layer separating | Severe |
| **Print Lines** | Lines visible in foil pattern | Minor to Moderate |

### Foil Grading Tips

- Examine under multiple light angles
- Scratches on foil are more visible and impactful than on non-foil
- Curling alone typically doesn't affect grade significantly
- Clouding can significantly lower grades
- Heavy foil damage often caps grades at 6 or below

---

## Grade Limiters

**A single major flaw can cap your grade regardless of how perfect everything else is.**

### Crease Severity

| Crease Type | Description | Maximum Grade |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Hairline** | Barely visible, surface intact | VG-EX 4 |
| **Minor** | Visible but doesn't crack surface | VG 3 |
| **Moderate** | Clearly visible, may show crack | Good 2 |
| **Heavy** | Deep crease, surface broken | Fair 1.5 |
| **Multiple** | Multiple creases | Poor 1 |

### Other Absolute Grade Limiters

| Defect | Maximum Grade | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Writing/Ink marks** | VG 3 | Any pen marks |
| **Tape residue** | Good 2 | Even if removed |
| **Trimming** | No grade (Authentic) | Altered card |
| **Heavy whitening** | VG-EX 4 | On black borders |
| **Water damage** | VG 3 or lower | Warping, staining |
| **Shuffle wear** | Varies | Common on played cards |
